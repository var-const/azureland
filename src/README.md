A simple Crimsonland clone, originally written in 10 days as a speed coding challenge. Handles 1000+ simultaneous colliding game entities. Uses [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/) and [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) internally. The code was originally compiled under Visual Studio 2010, porting to Linux is in progress.

Gameplay-wise, you hold on as long as you can against an endless horde of zombies; the longer you survive and the more zombies you kill, the higher your score. Story-wise, you're supposed to be a part of a special forces team sent on a suicide mission to try to contain the results of a bio-terror attack in a futuristic spaceport - a 22nd century Spartan.
